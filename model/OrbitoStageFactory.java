/**
 * HoleStageFactory must create the game elements that are defined in HoleStageModel
 * WARNING: it just creates the game element and NOT their look, which is done in HoleStageView.
 *
 * If there must be a precise position in the display for the look of a game element, then this element must be created
 * with that position in the virtual space and MUST NOT be placed in a container element. Indeed, for such
 * elements, the position in their virtual space will match the position on the display. For example, in the following,
 * the black pot is placed in 18,0. When displayed on screen, the top-left character of the black pot will be effectively
 * placed at column 18 and row 0.
 *
 * Otherwise, game elements must be put in a container and it will be the look of the container that will manage
 * the position of element looks on the display. For example, pawns are put in a ContainerElement. Thus, their virtual space is
 * in fact the virtual space of the container and their location in that space in managed by boardifier, depending of the
 * look of the container.
